## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible using any tools you found necessary.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS - use of Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned how to take a website design and fully implement it and closely replicate the design. This challenge helped me gain more confidence in my use and knowledge of flexbox. In addition, this challenge really helped me get my hands dirty with responsive web design. I am also very proud of my knowledge with the use of linear-gradients on the background-image property (see code below).

```css
.picture-side {
     background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(170, 92, 219,.5), rgba(170, 92, 219, .5)), url(../images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
}
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to participating in more challenges that further solidify my knowledge of flexbox and even start incorporating a mix of flexbox with CSS grid. I think this will give me solid foundational front-end skills. In addition, I look forward to improving my responsive design skills that will allow me to write more efficient code with less media queries.
